        <p>Our purpose is to efficiently eliminate any chance of human error and properly provide patients the correct medication and dosage amount for their needs. This is accomplished through our cutting-edge database, powered by rigorous algorithms, in order to perfect the dispersion of the right medication to the right individual every time, without compromise. This database assures that patients are precisely matched to their prescription, giving a unique serial number to each patient to guarantee there are no confusing factors such as similarities in name, age, etc. Additionally, we cooperate with partnered healthcare providers to ensure the health needs of every patient are provided and up-to-date, while facilitating proper communication between both patients and their providers. </p>
