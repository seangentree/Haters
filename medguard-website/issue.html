        <p>	According to the National Library of Medicine, medication errors account for one out of 131 outpatient deaths and one out of 854 inpatient deaths. Studies have also shown prescription errors by pharmacists. Medication errors have the potential to increase as a major contributor to avoidable morbidity and mortality as new medications are introduced for a wider range of indications. Therefore, medication error is only going to be a growing issue as the medical industry progresses. Before labels are printed out, hospitals have members of their medical staff manually check the prescriptions and the names to make sure each prescription does correspond with the correct person. However, due to this process, if one person was responsible for fifty patients prescriptions, they would have to manually check six different items per patient: Their first name, last name, date of birth, medication name, prescription dosage, and prescription expiration date. In total, that would be 300 values that person has to check, which maximizes human error. </p>
